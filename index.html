              <h3>About</h3>
              <p>
                I am a Master’s student in Operations Management at Yonsei University, advised by
                Professor Seunghwan Jung. My research focuses on how AI and data-driven methods reshape
                operations, markets, and human decision making.
              </p>
              <p>
                I received my B.B.A. from Yonsei University, where I was recognized with multiple
                merit-based scholarships, semester honors, and class MVP awards in analytics and
                operations courses.
